## Writing Code

### Fix existing bugs

This, in general, should be the most important task.

At the moment there are not critical bugs to be fixed, but several annoyances and enhancements that we'd like to fix.

To see all the issues already labeled as bug, you can use [this query](https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/issues?milestone=none&state=open&sort=created&labels=bug&direction=asc)

Some exemples are:

### Implement most wanted features and fixes (_bounty $325_)

Similarly, we have a quite important list of feature requests, that are labeled as [enhancement](https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/issues?milestone=none&state=open&sort=created&labels=enhancement&direction=asc),
of which some that have a [bounty](https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/issues?milestone=none&state=open&sort=created&labels=enhancement%2Cbounty&direction=asc) for those that will be able to implement them.

### Internal projects

- Refactorying [remmina_connection_window.c](https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/blob/next/remmina/src/remmina_connection_window.c) as it is big, complicated and hard to extend.
- Simplify the user interface.
- Separate plugin processes from the main process to improve stability.
- Write an additional plugin system to write plugins also in Python and eventually Ruby.
