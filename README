Remmina: The GTK+ Remote Desktop Client
=======================================

Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be useful for
system administrators and travellers, who need to work with lots of remote
computers in front of either large monitors or tiny netbooks. Remmina supports
multiple network protocols in an integrated and consistant user interface.
Currently RDP, VNC, NX, XDMCP and SSH are supported.

Remmina is released in separated source packages:
* "remmina", the main GTK+ application
* "remmina-plugins", a set of plugins

Remmina is free and open-source software, released under GNU GPL license.
