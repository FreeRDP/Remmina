A special thanks to:

The Remmina community, without them, Remmina wouldn't exists outside its owners
workstations.

Antenore Gatta and Giovanni Panozzo to have resurrected Remmina, without them,
it would be a dead project! Long life to Remmina and their maintainers!

Dario Cavedon, our "everything" counselor, writer, legal adviser and social
media expert.

Fabio Castelli (aka Muflone) to have brought some great improvements and
functionalities to Remmina.

Marc-Andr√© Moreau and Vic Lee, we are deeply grateful that you placed your
trust in us (Antenore & Giovanni) to represent Remmina.

Least but not last, the FreeRDP project the most advanced and updated RDP library
to date.
